# pyrq (DEPRECATED)

> **This repository is no longer maintained.**
>
> The functionality that was once in **pyrq** now lives in **[MacroLoaderXL](https://github.com/GearUnclear/MacroLoaderXL)**.

---

## Why the change?

MacroLoaderXL is a cleaner, actively-maintained successor that:

* Combines recording, editing, and playback in a single Python application.
* Supports adjustable playback speed, live status UI, and multi-monitor setups.
* Requires no administrator privileges—just install the Python dependencies and go.

All future bug fixes, feature requests, and documentation updates will occur in the new repository.

## Using pyrq (Legacy Instructions)

While deprecated, pyrq still functions as originally designed. Here's how to use it:

### Prerequisites

* Windows OS
* AutoHotkey installed
* Python 3.x installed with the following packages:

  ```bash
  pip install --user pyautogui pynput
  ```

### Workflow

1. Run `bingcorder2.ahk` to begin recording.

   * Press **F12** to start recording (clears any prior events).
   * Perform your desired mouse/keyboard actions.
   * Press **F11** to stop recording. This saves to `events.txt` and auto-generates `actions.ahk` using `2bing.py`.
2. `actions.ahk` is automatically launched via `restart_actions.ahk`.
3. Press **F1** to toggle playback on/off. The recorded macro will loop until stopped.

**Note:** You must not move the target window or application between record and playback or the macro will miss its target.

## File Overview

### Actively Used Files

* `bingcorder2.ahk` – The primary script to record events.
* `2bing.py` – Generates the `actions.ahk` script from recorded events.
* `restart_actions.ahk` – Helper script that launches the generated `actions.ahk`.

### Runtime-Generated Files

* `events.txt` – Stores the recorded events.
* `actions.ahk` – The AHK script generated by `2bing.py` for playback.

### Deprecated / Unused Files

* `bingcorder.ahk` – Old version of the recorder (replaced by `bingcorder2.ahk`).
* `googlecorder.ahk` – Experimental Chrome recorder.
* `2google.sucks.py` – Generator for Google playback macros.
* `events to ahk.ipynb` – Notebook prototype for event-to-AHK conversion.
* `runner.py` – Early script for system tray hotkeys, now unnecessary.

## Migration Steps

1. **Star / Watch** the new project: [MacroLoaderXL](https://github.com/GearUnclear/MacroLoaderXL).
2. Follow its README for installation and usage instructions.
3. Archive or delete your local copies of pyrq if they’re no longer needed.
