# pyrq (DEPRECATED)

> **This repository is no longer maintained.**
>
> The functionality that was once in **pyrq** now lives in **[MacroLoaderXL](https://github.com/GearUnclear/MacroLoaderXL)**.

---

## Why the change?

MacroLoaderXL is a cleaner, actively-maintained successor that:

* Combines recording, editing, and playback in a single Python application.
* Supports adjustable playback speed, live status UI, and multi-monitor setups.
* Requires no administrator privileges—just install the Python dependencies and go.

All future bug fixes, feature requests, and documentation updates will occur in the new repository.

## Migration Steps

1. **Star / Watch** the new project: [MacroLoaderXL](https://github.com/GearUnclear/MacroLoaderXL).
2. Follow its README for installation and usage instructions.
3. Archive or delete your local copies of pyrq if they’re no longer needed.

## License

pyrq remains under its original license, but it will receive **no further updates**. For the latest code under the same license, please use MacroLoaderXL.
